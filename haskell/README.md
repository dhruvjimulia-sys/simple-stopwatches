# Haskell Stopwatch
## Prerequisites
In order to run the program, you need to install GHC. This can be installed using the following command on Linux machines:
```
$ sudo apt install ghc
```
Note: This stopwatch was tested on GHC version 8.6.5 
## Getting Started
To begin with, compile the stopwatch.hs file with the following command:
```
$ ghci stopwatch.hs
```
Once the Haskell code has been compiled, you can start the stopwatch by calling the main method from the ghci prompt:
```
*Stopwatch> :main
```
